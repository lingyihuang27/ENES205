First Circuit

Finish this [555 simulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkixhhx8i3Q&vl=en) by watching the video .. figuring out where development stopped. Demonstrate the simulation to your instructor.

Finish the voltage divider by adding a resistor. Demonstrate the simulation to your instructor.

Build the circuit using the breadboard and resistors. Hook up a dc power supply, measure with a DMM and compare with the simulation.
