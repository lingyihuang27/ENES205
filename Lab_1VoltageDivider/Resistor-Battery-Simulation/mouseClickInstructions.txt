click on tools, then simulator
click on simulator, then settings
go to trasient tab check that the following came from the text directive above:
100u for the time step
10m for the final time
click on I(12v) (current through 12 volt source)
should be -12ma
click on I(1k) (current through 1k resistor)
should be + 12ma
click on V(Net-(12v-Pad1))
should be 12 volts and over write the green I(1k)
