The goal of these readme documents is a formal circuit documentation.  It [outlines the workflow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nUOedZwlwj_qvRuc3ERupAfwU3IGcgD4LE0l2Hs2M20/edit?usp=sharing). 

# Designed Circuit

This is can not be a screen shot of a KiCad circuit for these reasons:

 	1. As an engineering, you do not design in a simulator. You use the simulator to check your design.
 	2. KiCad circuit designs are ugly .. (but not the layout and 3D images of a circuit board .. not the eagle files). 
 	3. Designs start with nominal component values. 
 	4. Requirements need to be captured here. 
 	5. So design the circuit on paper in your notebook, draw it at at partSim.com, shoot a screen shot and put it here.

# Calculations

The goal of calculations is to calculate all the voltages and currents everywhere in the two circuits. 

Learn to do the calculations in Jupyter notebooks rather than matlab notebooks. Enthought Canopy is free. Matlab costs money. Look at the statics Matlab is going down, Python/Jupyter is going up. 

Your calculations can be in your notebook if done by hand but eventually you will have to use a calculating tool.  Start now. Do the parallel and serial resistor combinations in Python.

Summarize in this README.md file the calculations (and in your notebook). Link up the Juypter notebook here. 

# Simulation

An example simulation is in the folder called _1ResistorsSerialParallel. The simulation is set up for one resistor. Modify it twice for the two circuits.  Put a screen shot of the simulation in this file. 

# Build

If it is easy for you to put a picture from your phone here, take a picture of the circuit.  This is mostly done in lab, in your notebook.

# Take Data

You need to collect all the voltages and all the currents. Ideally you are using the same symbols in your Calculations, in the Simulation and in the Collected data.

In your notebook you need to draw pictures of how the test equipment is hooked to your circuit. Here just link up the data (there will be lots of it a file eventually). 

# Fix-Analyze

Computation should equal simulation should equal data.   
Fix circuit.   
Are you using the equipment properly?   
How are you going to learn?   
Which piece of equipment should be more accurate?   
Measure different ways.  
Learn how breadboard works.  
If instructor or someone else fixes, record what they did. Learn from them.  

Fixing circuits is open ended. At some point you will have to stop fixing. Fixing can go on forever. 

Finish with “Analyze”. **Summarize**: First summarize success. summarize the data so it is easy to compare Calculations with Simulation with Build. **The numbers should not match.**

**Errors:** Then focus on what is wrong. Do not hide anything. Do not gloss over anything. All circuits, all labs stop with errors. They are projects that can be continued for ever. **Don’t ever say “there were no errors.”**

**Next Steps:** Focus on what you would like to do if you had more time to work on the lab. This could be working with different instruments .. taking data different way .. designing the circuit different …  Modify the lab instructions or prompts (link to a document you create in this folder). The instructor will be reading this expecting to be stimulated in how to improve the lab.
